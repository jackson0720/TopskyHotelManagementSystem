# :family: Project Authors:

**Original Team: Jackson, Benjamin, Bin, Jonathan**

**Later Maintenance Team: Easy Open Meta (易开元)**

# :computer: Project Setup and Deployment:

**Download and install .NET SDK version 8 or above.**
**Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio Professional 2022 or above, unzip the downloaded Zip package, and run the .sln file.**

# :inbox_tray: Database Setup and Deployment (Local):

**The author and development team strongly recommend using the PostgreSQL database. Install the PostgreSQL database and start the service, establish the database through a visualization management tool, and quickly create data tables and import data by opening the .sql format files within the database script folder. Steps (using PostgreSQL database as an example):**

**1. Link to the PostgreSQL database through a visualization management tool, then create a new database named ‘tshoteldb’.**

**2. Open the db_file.sql in the database script\PostgreSQL version folder through the visualization management tool for data table creation and data import.**
